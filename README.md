# cuba-vision-clinic

This project shows how your LightSwitch application could look after migration to the CUBA Platform, taking official Microsoft [Vision Clinic Sample](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/Visual-Studio-LightSwitch-c8e92df4) as an example.

Migration is done automatically by reverse-engineering functionality, provided by the CUBA Studio.
